**Canadian Cannabis Comapnies**

This project is designed to create a visualisation about current financial growth of top 10 Canadian Cannabis Comapanies. 
There is not a lot of data aroud the growth of these comapanies since they are still in their nascent stage. It began with extracting the datasets.

The best source for this was each company's balance sheet. There was lot of information, however, we focussed on some of the key factors like 
profit, loss, current assets, liabilities, COGS (cost of goods sold), goodwill etc.
Python was used to generate and clean the datasets.



**Libraries used for visualisation**
Plotly, NVD3 and Leaflet

We used leaflet for this visualisation of various companies on the map and size of the purple circle is based on their 
respective sales.
